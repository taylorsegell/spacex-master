Before the launch SpaceX discovered that there was a crack in the nozzle of the 2nd stage's Merlin vacuum engine. So Elon just had them cut off the end of the nozzle with a pair of shears and launched the rocket a few days later. After SpaceX had trimmed the nozzle NASA was notified of the change and they agreed to it.[17]

This was due to one of the nine Merlin engines shutting down during the launch and NASA declining a second reignition as per ISS visiting vehicle safety rules the primary payload owner is contractually allowed to decline a second reignition. NASA stated that this was because SpaceX could not guarantee a high enough likelihood of the second stage completing the second burn successfully which was required to avoid any risk of secondary payload's collision with the ISS.[27][28][29]

This provided good test data even though the booster started rolling as it neared the ocean leading to the shutdown of the central engine as the roll depleted it of fuel resulting in a hard impact with the ocean.[31] This was the first known attempt of a rocket engine being lit to perform a supersonic retro propulsion and allowed SpaceX to enter a public-private partnership with NASA and its Mars entry descent and landing technologies research projects.[34] (more details below)

The test achieved many objectives and returned a large amount of data but the grid-fin control surfaces used for the first time for more precise reentry positioning ran out of hydraulic fluid for its control system a minute before landing resulting in a landing crash.[72]

The third International Docking Adapter (IDA-3) a replacement for the first IDA lost during the CRS-7 launch anomaly was one of the external payloads on this mission.[466] Along with food and science the Dragon also carried the ELaNa 27 RFTSat CubeSat[467] and MakerSat-1 which will be used to demonstrate microgravity additive manufacturing. The satellite is expected to be launched by a Cygnus dispenser later in July 2019.The booster used on this flight was the same used on CRS-17 earlier in the year; originally it was planned to reuse it again for the CRS-19 mission later this year[468] but the plan was scrapped. For the first time the twice flown Dragon spacecraft also made a third flight.[469] Also used for the first time was a gray-band painted where the RP-1 kerosene tank is located to help with thermal conductivity and thus saving fuel during long coasts.[470]

This booster became the second Block 5 booster to be expended.[474][477] For the second time Ms. Tree managed to catch a fairing half directly into its net.[478]

Also on board were upgrades for the Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL). Onboard experiments include the testing of the spread of fire in space mating barley in microgravity and experiments to test muscle and bone growth in microgravity.[485] Secondary payloads include the Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) an experiment to image high resolution across all colours of the light spectrum allowing for imaging of soil rocks vegetation snow ice and man-made objects. Additionally there were three CubeSats from NASA's ELaNa 28 mission[381] including the AztechSat-1 satellite built by students in Mexico.[485]
